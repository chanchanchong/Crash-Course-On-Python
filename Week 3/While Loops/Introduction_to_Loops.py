# Hi there, and welcome back. Before we dive back in I want to first
# say well done. We've learned a lot of new skills in a short amount of time
# and tackled some pretty concepts. None of this stuff is easy and
# you're doing so great. So we've got some fun concepts lined up of the
# next few videos. So far we've seen how to organize our code and functions.
# We've also made our code branch in two different paths depending on
# certain conditions. In this module we'll learn how to get computers to do
# repetitive tasks, which is another cornerstone of programming. As we've
# called out before computers are great at repeating the same task over and
# over. They never get bored or make a mistake. You could ask a computer
# to do the same calculation a thousand times in the first result would be
# just as accurate as the last, which isn't something we can say about us
# humans. Have you ever tried to do something at thousand times in a row,
# it be enought to drive you loopy, which is why in this course, we're going to
# learn how to leave the loops up to the computer. The ability to accurately
# perform repetitive tasks and never get tired is why computers are so great
# for automation. The automated task could be anything like copying files to
# a bunch of computers on a network, sending personalized emails to a list
# of users, or verifying that a process is still running. It doesn't matter how
# complex the task is your computer will do it as many times as you tell it to,
# which leaves you time for more interesting things like planning future
# hardware needs, or managing software roll out. In the next few videos
# we'll explore three techniques for automating repetitive tasks. There are
# while loops. for loops. and recursion. Each of these techniques are used to
# tell the computer to repeat a task, but each takes a slightly different
# approach. We're going to learn how to write the code for each and how to
# know when to use one technique instead of the others. So, are you ready?
# Let's get started.
