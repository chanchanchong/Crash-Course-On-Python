Create a daily report that tracks the use of
machines. Specifically, she wants to know which
users are currently connected to which machines, it's
your job to create the report.

In your company, there's a system that collects every
event that happens on the machines on the network.
Among the many events collected it records each
time a user logs in our out of a computer. With
this information, we want to write a script that
generates a report of which users are logged in
to which machines at that time.

The input is a list of events, each event is an
instance of the event class. An event class
contains the date
class Event:
    # Event date
    Date = ""
    # Machine name
    Machine = ""
    # User
    User = ""
    # Event type
    Type = "" (e.g., "Login", "Logout")

or?

class Event:
    def __init__(self):
        self.Date
        self.Machine
        self.User
        self.Type


s = event()
e = event()
events = [event(), event(), event()]

Report
webserver.local:
- kay
- taylor
- charlie

or

webserver.local:
kay, taylor, charlie

mailserver.local:

Problem statement?
We need to process a list of Event objects using their
attributes to generate a report that lists all users
currently logged in to the machines.
