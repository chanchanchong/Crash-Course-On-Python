# Welcome back and congratulations on getting this far. I sure I'm glad
# we didn't lose you and all those loops we covered in the last module.
# You're doing great and making tons of progress. In earlier videos, we
# covered the basic elements of Python syntax. We talked about how to
# define functions, how to make your computer act differently based on
# conditionals, and how to make it perform operations repeatedly using
# while, and for loops, and recursion. Now that we have the basics of
# syntax out of the way, we can start growing our Python knowledge
# which will let us do more and more interesting operations. Remember,
# one of our main goals in this course is to help you learn to write short
# Python scripts that automate actions, you've made big steps towards
# getting there. In the upcoming videos, we're going to learn a bunch of
# new super useful skills to add to your programming toolbox. We'll
# check out some datatypes provided by the Python language to help us
# solve common problems with our scripts. In particular, will do a deep
# dive into strings, lists, and dictionaries. Heads-up, while we've used
# strings in our scripts already, we barely scratched the surface of all the
# things we can do with them in Python. We also ran into a few lists in
# some examples but there's a lot more of them we haven't seen yet.
# Dictionaries are a whole new datatype for us to dig our teeth into.
# These are all data types or data structures that are super flexible.
# We're going to use them to write all kinds of scripts in Python. So it's a
# good idea to spend some time getting to know them, and learning
# when to use them, and how to make the most out of them. We've got a
# lot of new and exciting concepts to discover. So let's get right to it.
