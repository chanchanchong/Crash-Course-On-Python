# On the whole, for a program to be useful it needs to get at least
# some information from the user. With this data, the program can take
# actions that are relevant from the user, instead of generic actions, like
# printing hello world. Data can be provided to a computer in a bunch of
# different ways. For example, on a website you might input data by
# entering text into text fields or clicking links. If you're using a mobile
# application, maybe you'll click on buttons or select preferences from a
# drop-down menu. In a command line program, you might provide
# additional data by passing strings this parameters to the program, or you
# could have the program ask you for data interactively. All of these various
# platforms, programs, and apps process data differently. Some might take
# the contents of a file as data to the processed, others gather data from
# other sources and process it in the background. Remember our earlier
# example, when we automated the process of identifying and removign
# duplicate emails? There, the data provided to the program was the list of
# emails, which would usually be given in a file that lists the emails one per
# line. Whichever way your application gets the data, ti will need to come
# from somewhere. For our first examples in this course, we'll just have teh
# data as its own line in our block of code. This is limited, but
# straightforward. Later in this course, and in upcoming courses, we'll
# introduce you to better ways of feeding data into your code. For now
# though, let's see this idea in action in a very simple example.

# By having the name separate from the call to the print function, we're
# making the line of code that calls the print function generic, while still
# personalizing the greeting. If we then wanted to say hello to a different
# person, we only need to change the name, but the call to the print function
# will remain the same. Pretty simple, right? Next up, we'll learn a few other
# easy things that you can get Python to do for you.
