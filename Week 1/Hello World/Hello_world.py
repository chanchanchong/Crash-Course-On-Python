# Now that you've got an idea of what Python code looks like, let's check out
# one of the most basic examples and dive deeper into what's going on. Get
# ready. We're going to use the Python interpreter to make our computer
# say hello to the world. When we run this code either locally on your
# machine or on a web interpreter, the words hello word appear on the
# screen, just like magic. Actually it's not magic. It's because Print is a Python
# function that writes what we tell it on the screen. Like the statement
# hello word for example, the print function is part of the basic Python
# language, whenever we use keywords or functions is part of the
# language, we're using the programming language's syntax to tell the
# computer what to do. So what are functions and keywords? Functions are
# pieces of code that perform a unit of work. We'll talk a lot more about
# functions later on, and you'll even learn how to write your own. Keywords
# are reserved words that are used to construct instructions. These words
# are the core part of the language and can only be used in specific ways.
# Some examples include if, while, and for. We'll explain all of those and a
# bunch more later in the course. As we called out, the keywords and
# functions used in Python are what makes up the syntax of the language.
# Once we understand how they work, we can use them to construct more
# complex expressions that get the computer to do what we want it to do.
# Last off, notice how hello world is written between double quotation
# marks. Wrapping text in quotation marks indicates that the text is
# considered a string, which means it's text that will be manipulated by our
# script. In programming, any text that isn't inside quotation marks is
# considered part of the code. Now, for a bit of trivia, do you know why we
# printed the whole world in our example? Well, printing hello world has
# been the traditional way to start learning a programming language since
# way back in the '70s when it was used as the first example in a famous
# programming book called the C programming language. That example
# looked like this.

# In Python, the hello world example is just one line, in C it's three lines, in
# other languages, it can be even more. While learning to write hello world
# won't teach you the whole language, it gives you a first impression of how
# functions are used, and how a program written in that language looks. All
# right, now that we've written our first piece of Python code, I think you're
# ready for something a bit more challenging than hello world. Ready? Let's
# do it.
print("Hello, world!")
print("I'm programming in Python")
