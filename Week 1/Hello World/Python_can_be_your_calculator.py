# Python can be your calculator

# There's a ton of things that you can do with Python and you'll learn many
# of them in this course. But before we dive into complex subjects, let's have
# some fun with another simple task that you can do with Python. We are
# going to make Python our calculator. Let's start with something easy. So 4
# plus 5 is 9, 9 times 7 is 63, minus 1 divided by 3, the digit 3 repeats
# forever after the decimal point. Of course, it's hard to display something
# that repeats for ever. So instead, we have a representation showing lots of
# decimal places. Not too hard, right? Let's get the computer somethinga a bit
# trickier. Let's say we want to divide 2050 by 5, then subtract 32 and the
# divide the result by 9. To do this, we'll need to use parentheses, just as we
# do in typical math problems. You can also use Python to give us the squares,
# dubes, or any power of n of a number. For example, let's say we want to
# find out what 2 to the power of 10 is. To get Python to give us the answer,
# we use the double star operator. If you're starting to worry that this is
# becoming an algebra course, relax. We're not goint to do anything more
# complex than what we've just seen. If you're thinking, "Why would I use
# Python instead of just a normal calculator?" That's a valid question.
# Experimentation in this way, you get familiar with the language's math
# capabilities. In IT jobs, there are many tasks that require you to use math
# calculations. You might need to count how many times a certain word
# appears in a text, or work out you the average time it takes for an opeartion to
# complete, or how much you ahve to compress an image to fit in certain
# size constraints. Whatever you need to calculate, writing a script can helop
# you do it faster and with more accuracy. So you need to know what
# mathematical operations are available to you. Python actually has a lot
# more advanced numberic capabilities that are used for data analysis,
# statistics, machine learning, and other scientific applications. We won't get
# into these in this course. But if you want to learn more about them on
# your own, there's a wealth of online resources available. Next up, a cheat
# sheet to help you with programming concepts that we've just covered.
# After that, it's time for another quiz. This time with a few small coding
# exercises. Remember, if something is unclear, you can re-watch the videos
# as many times as you need. Ready? You've got this.
