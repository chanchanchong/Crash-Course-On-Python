# Welcome back, How did you do on your first quiz? If you got most of the
# questions right, great job. If not, no worries it's all part of elarning. We'll be here
# to help you check that you've really got your head around these concepts with
# regular quizzes like this. If you ever find a question tricky, go back and review the
# videos and then try the quiz again. You want to feel super comfortable with what
# you've learned before jumping into the next lesson. Remember, take your time. I
# will be here whenever you're ready to move on. Okay. Feeling good? Great. Let us
# dive in. In this course, we will use the Python programming language to
# demonstrate basic programming concepts and how to apply them to writing
# scripts. We have mentioned that there are a bunch of programming languages
# out there. So why pick Python? Well, we chose Python for a few reasons. First off,
# programming in Python usually feels similar to using a human language. This is
# because Python makes it easy to express what we want to do with syntax that's
# easy to read and write. Check out this example. There is a lot to unpack here so
# don't worry if you don't understand it right away, we'll get into the nitty-gritty
# details later in the course. But even if you've never seen a line of code before,
# you might be able to guess what this code does. It defines a list with names of
# friends and then creates a greeting for each name in the list. Now it is your turn
# to make friends with Python. Try it out and see what happens. Throughout this
# course, you will execute Python code using your web browser. We'll start with
# some small coding exercises using code blocks just like the one you
# experimented with. Later on as you develop your skills, you'll work on larger
# more complex coding exercises using other tools. Getting good at something
# Takes a whole lot of practice every example we share in this course on your
# own. If you do not have Python installed on your machine, no worries, you can
# still practice using an online Python interpreter. Check out the next reading for
# links to the most popular Python interpreters available online. Now I am sure you
# are wondering what the heck is a Python interpreter. In programming, an
# interpreter is the program that reads and executes code. Remember how we said
# a computer program is like a recipe with step-by-step instructions? Well, if your
# recipe is written in Python, the Python interpreter is the program that reads what
# is in the recipe and translates it into instructions for your computer to follow.
# Eventually, you'll want to install Python on your computer so you can run it locally
# and experiment with it as much as you like. We'll guide you through how to
# install Python in the upcoming course but you don't have to have it installed to
# get your first taste of Python. You can practice with the quizzes we provide and
# with the online interpreters and code pads that we'll give you links to in the next
# reading. We'll provide a whole bunch of exercises but feel free to come
# up with your own and share them in the discussion forums. Feel free to get
# creative. This is your change to show off your new skills.
