# Remember how we mentioned that Python is simple and easy to use?
# Python makes it easy to express the fundamental concepts of programming like
# data structures and algorithms with easy to read syntax. This makes Python a
# great language to use to learn programming. And there are other reasons to pick
# Python, too. Python is super popular in the IT industry, making it one of the most
# common programming languages used today. Python isn't new. Its first version
# was released by Guido van Rossum back in 1991. Since then, the community that
# develops it has grown and the language has advanced a lot. Whenever there's a
# significant change to the semantics or syntax of the language, an new major
# version is released. In 2000, Python 2 was released. In 2008, we got Python 3. In
# this course, we'll use Python 3.7, which came out in 2018. For many years, Python
# was considered a beginner's language and was mostly used for teaching
# concepts or writing very small simple scripts, like in this course. But in recent
# years, the adoption of Python has grown dramatically. One reason for this is that
# the language has become more powerful. It's' also because there's more tools
# available in Python for a growing range of applications. You can use Python to
# calculate statistics, run your e-commerce site, process images, interact with
# web services, and do a whole host of other task. Python is perfect for automation. It
# understand and easy to maintain. That' why Python is the language of choice for
# lots of people working in IT support, system administration, and web
# development. Not only that, but it's also used in fast-growing areas of IT, like
# machine learning or data analytics. Last but not lear, Python is available for
# download on a wide variety of operating systems, like Windows, Linux and Mac
# OS. And what's more, Python is so popular in the workplace that if you are
# currently working it IT, you've most likely encountered it already. And if you're
# planning a career in It, chances are you'll interact with Python quite a bit. So
# there's a whole lot of reasons for why Python is relevant to today's IT industry. A
# large part of programming is learning through trial and error and asking
# questions. So if at any point you get stuck, don't get discouraged. Making
# mistakes helps you improve. The more you see failure or broken code as an
# opportunity to lear, the quicker you'll master programming. I remember the
# first Python script I ever wrote. It took a lot of refactoring, debugging, and testing
# to get it to work. I relied on a lot of my teammates for help and mentorship and
# would up spending more time on Stack Overflow than actually writing the code.
# Thankfully, you don't hae to reinvent the wheel. There's almost always someone
# on the Internet who's trying to do what you're doing and can help point you in
# the right direction when you're stuck. Sometimes it takes a village. It's really
# important to keep in mind that even experienced programmers may need to ask
# a colleague a question from time to time or look something up on the Internet.
# Whether you're a programming novice or have some experience in software
# development, remember, the best programmers overcome challenges by seeking
# help or using other resources. Once you've completed this program, you'll be
# well on your way to confidently programming in basic Python. There's a lots of
# information online that will help you continue to develop your programming
# skills. For example, there are lots of online courses for specific programming
# languages. You'll find answers to your Python coding questions in the official
# Python documentation. You can use sites like Stack Overflow to discuss and
# share with other developers. And you can ask questions in our discussion
# forums. You can even subscribe to some of the Python mailing lists to keep in the
# know on the latest updates to the language. You're opening the door to the
# whole world of programming, and it's super exciting to joining the
# development community. The most important thing to remember is that you're
# never alone. Any questions you may have, any time in your career, there are
# resource out there to help you find the answer you need. Wow, that
# was a lot of information. Feel free to take a quick break, grab something to drink,
# and then head on over to the supplemental reading to learn more about Python
# and the resources out there to help you learn.
