# Although we picked Python for this course, it's important to note that it's
# just one of the many coding languages out there. Think of a given programming
# language as just one of the many powerful tools in your IT toolbox. Each
# language has its unique set of pros and cons. Some fun faster than others. Some
# are better suited for enterprise applications. Others are particularly good at
# crunching numbers. There are platform-specific scripting languages like
# PowerShell which is used on Windows, and Bash which is used on Linux. Both are
# widely used for scripting and automation. Javascript, which was originally
# developed as a client-side scripting language for the web is increasingly used as
# server side for a broader set of tasks. And the list doesn't stop there. There's a
# vary array of traditional languages to explore like C, C++, Java or Go. As you
# progress in your career in IT, you'll probably encounter a number of different
# languages and learn when to use each of them. But let's not get ahead of
# ourselves. First, we have Python to get our heads around. A nice feature of
# learning the basics of programming in one language is that you can generally
# apply the same concepts you learn to other languages. This means that once
# you're familiar with Python, you'll find it easier to pick up new coding languages
# as you'll spot and understand similarities and differences between them. After
# all, every language needs to do some common things like create variables,
# control the flow of a program, read input, and display output, even if they do
# these tasks using different approaches. As we called out earlier, learning a
# programming language is somewhat similar to learning a foreign language. You'll
# need to grasp the syntax and semantics for that language. Luckily for us, once
# you know the fundamentals of programming, learning another language is much
# easier than learning second foreign language. To explore some of the
# similarities and differences between various scripting languages, let's take a look
# at a simple program that prints the words hello words ten times in three different
# languages, Python, Bash, PowerShell. As you can see, each languages uses a
# different approach to printing hello world. But look closer and you'll see
# similarities too. Each language must somehow put text onto the screen. The
# command for Python is print, for Bash it's echo, and for PowerShell it's Write-
# Host. Also notice that each language has to count to ten in some way. While
# Python does this by specifying range(10), Bash uses a sequence notation to count
# from 1 to 10. PowerShell has the most complex syntax in this example, but it also
# boils down to starting at 1 and counting up to 10, So as we've just seen there's a
# whole lot of programming languages out there, but don't let that scare you. In
# this course, you will only need to focus on learning Python. Once you can speak
# Python you can go on to learn any other language you want. Up next, we've got
# another quiz to help you practice what you've just learned.

[print("Hello, World!") for _ in range(10)]
