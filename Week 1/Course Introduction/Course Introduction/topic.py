# If you work in It, computer programming skills open up an incredible
# amount of opportunity. Being able to write scripts and programs that tell your
# computer to perform a task equips you with an invaluable tool. Not only does it
# make your work easier and more efficient, it can help you grow faster and
# advance further in your IT career. But how do you even start to learn a
# programming language like Python? How do you recognize when to tell a
# computer to perform a task? And hwo do you then write a program to actually
# get your computer complete the task you want it to do? The thought of learning
# to write a program in Python can make you feel a whole bunch of emotions
# excitement, anticipation that feeling of wanting to dive right in and get going and
# also fear. You might ask yourself, can I really learn how to code or do I have it in
# me? I'm here to tell you, yes, you can absolutely do this. Learning how to program
# can be scary and intimidating, but at the same time it's really fun and really
# exciting. I coding as in life, if we're going to get philosophical, the most rewarding
# work is usually a bit challenging, but ultimately well worth the effort. Of course,
# I'm able to say this from experience, especially the cheesy parts. My name is
# Christine Rafla. I'm a systems administrator at Google and I'm going to be your
# instructor and guide in this course. The role of a sysadmin can vary a lot from
# company to company and even within different teams in the same company. I
# happen to work in the corporate identity and access certain resource, they can.
# What I love the most about being a sysadmin is that the role has so many diverse
# functions. We handle loads of unique problems and edge cases from tinkering
# with different systems to collaborating with other teams. I am always learning
# something new, so it's really hard to get bored. It all starts with knowing how to
# automate, if you're an IT support specialist, a system administrator, or in a role
# somewhere in between knowing how to get computers to do the hard work for
# you will set you apart from others in similar it roles and make your life much
# easier. Think about it, would you rather manually deploy 100 computers on your
# own or tell your computer to do it all for you all at once? No-brainer, right, having
# a coding skill set can help you  grow into more specialized roles like a systems
# administrator, Cloud Solutions engineer, DevOps specialist, site reliability
# engineer, or who knows maybe even web developer or data analyst. The point is,
# being able to write a program is an essential tool in your IT toolkit and more and
# more employers are looking for these skills in the people they hire. If you've ever
# learned a new skill, like playing a musical instrument, speaking a foreign
# language, knitting, or skateboarding. You know that getting good at something
# new requires a lot of practice. For me, I love to learn new language and I'm
# proud to say I speak Spanish, Arabic, French, and I even know ten words in
# Russian. Our world is shaped by the words and the languages we speak and while
# some words may be unique to one language you can always find similarities that
# help you learn and understand. Being able to connect the dots between cultures
# allows me to see things others might not, kind of sounds like this applies of IT
# programming, huh? My point is, whether you're learning French or Python, it's
# never easy. You have to start small, learn the basics and practice those until you
# master them. Only then can you move on to more complex and impressive stuff
# and I'm here to help you along that path along with my colleagues who you'll
# meet in later courses. We'll start slow, master the foundation's together and you'll
# soon be ready for more challenging stuff. So are you wondering why we filmed
# this course in a cabin on a lake in Canada. The truth is were actually in a game
# room at one of the Google offices in Sunnyvale, California. We chose a different
# themed office space for each course of the program just to mix things up and I
# think I scored with this one. I should warn my manager that I'll be hanging out in
# this one well after the course ends because it's super comfy. Bu the end of this
# course, you'll understand the benefits of programming in IT roles. You'll be able
# to write simple programs using Python, figure out how the building blocks of
# programming fit together, and combine all this knowledge to solve a complex
# programming problem. That's right, by the end of this course, you're going to
# write program in Python that's designed to solve a real-world IT problem, super
# exciting right? We'll start iff by diving into the basics of writing a computer
# program. You'll get hands-on experience with programming concepts through
# interactive exercises and real-world examples. You'll quickly start to see how
# computer can perform multitude of tasks. You just have to write code that tells
# them what to do. Along the way, we'll be talking about automation, which is
# process of getting computers to automatically do a task that us humans normally
# have to do by hand. Now, some of the stuff can get a little complex and
# confusing. I promise to do my best to make these lessons clear and easy to
# understand, but if get stuck at any point, please feel free to re-watch the
# videos. Practice as much as you like and take the time you really need to stand
# these topics. The goal of this course isn't to teach you everything there is to know
# about software engineering becaise yikes, that would be a long course, Instead,
# we're going to introduce you to some of the key concepts of programming adn
# scripting that will empower you to spot opportunities for automation in real life.
# You're about to learn a skill that can help you take your career to whole new
# levels. Are you excited? I'm excited, so let's jump in.
