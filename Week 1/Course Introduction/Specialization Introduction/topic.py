# Working in It is more than just a job. It's a career path. Research shows
# that the field of IT support is a launchpad for future career growth and
# better wages. In fact, a study on the subject was recently conducted by
# the Harvard Business School Accenture and Burning Glass entitled
# Bridge the Gap. It found that among today's middle-skilled jobs which
# require training but not a formal college degree, IT support offers clear
# pathways to prosperity. We saw this phenomenon play out here at
# Google, in out IT support program. Those who push themselves to
# learn how to code in Python typically saw strong career growth. They
# built skills that are critical to accessing higher level positions in the IT
# field, and after honing those skills through hard work and
# determination, they advanced into more technical IT support
# specialists. System administrators, technical solutions engineers, and
# even site reliability engineers. The common thread across all of these
# roles is knowing how to write code to solve programs and automate
# solutions. By expanding your toolbox to include coding skills, you open
# a window into the world of systems management that can lead you
# towards more advanced technical roles down the line. Python in
# particular is having a huge surgeons. According to the 2019 Stack
# Overflow Developer Survey. Python is the coding language most
# people want to learn. The second most loved by those who already
# know it and the fourth most popular overall. So why take this program
# to learn how to code in Python? Well, first it's geared towards people
# who are already in or aspiring to be in the field of IT. Maybe you're
# thinking bigger about your current IT role and want to work towards
# managing operations at scale, or maybe you're just starting out and
# looking to break into the IT industry. Perhaps you've taken our IT
# Support Professional Certificate program on Coursera already, or you
# have equivalent IT support knowledge with basic computing skills, like
# working with files nd directories, familiarity with basic computing skills, like
# and understanding how to install software on your computer. In any
# case, this program is tailor-made for you. Second, this program offers
# three hands-on methods of teaching coding and Python and
# automation. Code blocks, Jupyter notebooks, and Qwiklabs. Third,
# we've assembled an awesome group of Googlers who will serve as
# your instructor in each course. The all started their careers in IT
# support then learned programming and moved onto more technical
# roles like me. We can't wait to share out stories with you on how we
# use Python in our day-to-day. Oh and hey. I should probably introduce
# myself. My name is Christine Rafla, and I'm a Systems Administrator at
# Google. I will be your instructor in this course. This program has been
# entirely designed and developed by Google and we even filmed each
# course at different cool Google spaces. It will introduce you to the
# Python programming language with a special focus on how this
# language applies to automating tasks in the world of IT systems
# support and administration. I'm super excited to be here with you.
# When I was younger, I had no idea that careers in IT even exited.
# There are a lot of reasons I wanted to participate in the certificate
# program. But one of my biggest motivations is that I want to see more
# women represented in the industry. I remember going to a System
# Administration Summit where there were hundreds of men and about
# three women that were  sysadmins. A lot has changed since then but
# there's still so much we can do to bring new ideas and representation
# into the IT field. That's why I want to share my knowledge wit has many
# people as possible. I love my job and I love the people I work with
# because they make it easy to ask for help and offer their guidance. This
# type of support network allows our team and ultimately our industry to
# be more successful. I understand from experience that it can fell
# pretty intimidating and maybe even a bit scary to learn a coding
# language. Just remember, everyone started where you are right now
# with the first command, the first script, and of course, the first of many
# errors. When I started out my career, I strive to get everything
# perfectly right the first time I tried it. But that actually slowed down my
# progress. So don't be afraid to make mistakes, it will give you a leg up.
# So, let's get down to it. What's ahead? The program begins with a crash
# course in Python where you will learn to write simple programs and
# understand their role in automation. Next, we'll get more hands-on
# focus on how Python interacts with the operating system. After that,
# we'll cover how to use Git and Github to manage versions of your
# code. Then we will focus on troubleshooting and debugging techniques
# to find and solve the root cause of problems in IT infrastructure. The
# net course covers automating at scale where you will learn to deploy
# configuration management on a fleet of either physical or virtual machines
# running in the Cloud. Last up, we will bring all this knowledge together and
# complete a final project designed to solve tasks you might encounter in
# real-world IT settings. Bonus, you can post your projects to Github to show off
# your fancy new skills to employers or friends or both. That was a lot to rattle off.
# Are you excited or what? Now I'd like to quickly introduce you to my fellow instructors
# who you will get to meet along the way. Hey, my name is Roger Martinez. I'm a
# Linux System Administrator, and I'll be your instructor in the course on
# using Python's interacts with operating system. Hi, I'm Kenny Sulma, and I'll
# be your guide in the course about using Git and Github to manage
# versions of your code. Hi there. I'm Amanda Ballas, and I'll be teaching you
# about troubleshooting and debugging. Hey, I'm Phelan Vendeville, and in
# my course, we'll learn about Automation at scale using Configuration
# Management and the Cloud. Thanks everyone. This all-star team was brought
# together to guide you on your adventures in coding. You're in very
# good hands. Okay, I think that's everything. Let's get ready to learn some new
# skills and maybe even have some laughs along the way. I'll see you in
# the next video.
