# As the Chinese proverb says, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single
# step. Today's a big day, you're taking your first step in your journey to learn how
# to write scripts in Python. It's going to be a little challenging at times, but really it's
# not that scary. We'll go slow and give you everything you need to fully grasp each
# concept before we move along. In the next few videos, you'll discover the
# fundamental concepts of computer programming. You'll learn what a
# programming language is, what scripting is, what languages are out there other
# than Python, and how this all relates to IT. We'll also have you coding before you
# know it with small coding exercises we've cooked up to give you hands-on
# practice with Python. This will include writing your very first Python script. But
# always keep in mind, if at any point along the way you feel lost or confused, don't
# panic. You can watch the videos as many times as you need to let the concept
# sink in, plus you can ask questions in the discussion forums, which is one of the
# best ways to find extra information and connect with other learners. When I was
# asked to participate in this progra, it made me think about when I first started
# to code. If I could give that younger version of myself a piece of advice, this is
# what I would tell her, it never works the first time. Seriously, as a newbie, I
# expected it all to work like magicc. I thought that the following the rules and getting it
# right the first time would prove my value as a coder, but that's just not true, not
# even the best of the best. If you expect to write perfect code on the first shot
# you're going to be dissappointed. You hear that younger self? Try not to feel
# overwhelmed by the details. Connecting the dots only comes with experience, so
# the best way to learn is to just jump in. The truth is everyone learns at their own
# pace. If you already know some of these concepts , feel free to skip ahed to the
# parts that interests you the most. If you're starting from scratch, take as long as
# you need for each concept. The assessments will be right there waiting for you
# when you're done, and if at any point you start doubting yourself, remember,
# even the most advanced programmers started thinking, Python? What's Python?
# Well, we're about to learn all about it, so let's dive in. Next up, we'll be doing a
# rundown of what programming is.
