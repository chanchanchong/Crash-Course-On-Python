# Although we might not realize it, we reap the benefits of automation all
# the time in our daily lives. Do you ever pay your bills with scheduled payments or
# use a self check out at the grocery store? I always set my coffee machine to start
# brewing before I've even gotten out of bed. The promise of fresh coffee makes
# early mornings way easier. Automation is the process of replacing a manual step
# with one that happens automatically. Take a traffic light for example, which
# continuously regulates the flow of vehicles at an intersection. A traffic light
# requires a human intervention only when it needs repairs or maintenance. The
# automatic regulation of traffic means that human don't have to stand at the
# intersection manually signaling when cars should stop or go. Instead, people can
# concentrate on more complex, creative or difficult tasks like focusing on where
# you're driving. What's more, traffic lights don't get tired, bored, or accidentally
# display a green light when they meant red. This highlights another benefit of
# automation consistency. Let's face it, us humans are flawed and sometimes we
# make mistakes, a human performing the same tasks hundred of times will never
# be as consistent as a machine doing the same thing. But for all of its advantages
# automation isn't a solution for every situation, some tasks just aren't suited for
# automation. For example, they may require a degree of creativity or flexibility
# that automatic systems can't provide or for more complicated or less frequently
# executed tasks creating the automation may actually be more effort or cost than
# it's worth. Think about when you get a haircut. What would it take to automate
# the actions of cutting hair length, and desired hairstyle would all need to be taken
# into account when designing the automatic system. We need to replicated the
# creativity and skills of a trained specialist along with extensive testing to ensure
# the clients safety and quality haircut, And if you've ever had a bad experience at a
# hair salon, you know quality can be subjective. In this case, the cost and effort of
# automation just isn't worth the benefits of an automatic haircut would provide
# which is why we don't have robot hairstylists. Not too complex, right? Automation
# is a powerful tool when used in the right place at the right moment. It can save
# time, reduce errors, increase consistency, and provide a way to centralized
# solutions and mistakes making them easier to fix. Throughout this course, and an
# upcoming ones we'll be talking about when it makes sense to apply automation
# and exactly how you do it. Eventually knowing when and where to use
# automation will become automatic for you.
