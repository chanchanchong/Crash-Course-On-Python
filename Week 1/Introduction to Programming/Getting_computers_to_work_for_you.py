# Working in IT, a lot of what we do boils down to using a computer to perform a
# certain task. In your job you might create user accounts, configure the network,
# install software, backup existing data, or execute a whole range of other
# computer based tasks from day to day. Back in my first IT job, I realized that
# every day I came into work I typed the same three commands to authenticate
# into systems. Those credentials timed out everyday by design, for security
# reasons, so I created a script that would automatically run these commands for
# me every morning to avoid having to type them myself. Funny enough, the team
# that monitors anomalous activity discovered my little invention and contacted
# me to remove it, oops. Tasks performed by a computer that need to be done
# multiple times with little variation are really well suited for automation, because
# when you automate a task you avoid the possibility of human errors, and reduce
# the time it takes to do it. Imagine this scenario, your company had a booth at a
# recent conference and has gathered a huge list of emails from people interested
# in learning more about your products. You want to send these people your
# monthly email newsletter, but some of the people on the list are already
# subscribed to receive it. So how do you make sure everyone receives your
# newsletter, without accidentally sending it to the same person twice? Well, you
# could manually check each email address one by one to make sure you only add
# new ones to the list, sounds boring and inefficient, right? It could be, and it's also
# more error prone, you might accidentally miss new emails, or add emails that
# were already there, or it might get so boring you fall asleep at your desk, Even
# your automated coffee machine won't help you out there. So what could you do
# instead? You could get the computer to do the work for you. You could write a
# program that checks for duplicates, and the adds each new email to the list.
# Your computer will do exactly as its told no matter how many emails there are in
# the list, so it won't get tired or make any mistakes. Even better, once you've
# written the program you can use the same code in the future situations, saving
# you even more time, pretty cool, right? It gets better, think about when you're
# going to send these emails out, if you send them out manually you'll have to send
# the same email to everybody, personalizing the emails would be way too much
# manual work. If instead you use automation to send them, you could have the
# name and company of each person added to the email automatically. The result?
# More effective emails, without you spending hours inserting names into the text.
# Automating tasks allows you to focus on projects that are a  better use of your
# time, letting computer do the boring stuff for you. Learning how to program is
# the first step to being able to do this, if you want to get computers to do the
# work for you, you're in the right place. Earlier in this video I told you about the
# first task I ever automated, now I want to tell you about coolest thing I ever
# automated. It was a script that changed a bunch of access permissions for a
# whole lot of Google Internal Services. The script reversed a large directory tree
# with tons of different files, checked the file contents, and then updated the
# permissions to the services based on the conditions that I laid out in the script.
# Okay, I admit I'm total nerd, but I still think it's really cool. Next up, it's time to
# share your ideas. What things would you like to automate using programming?
# While these discussion prompts are optional, they're really fun. Seriously, they let
# you get to know your fellow learners a bit, and collaborate on ideas and insights.
# Make sure you read what others are saying, they may give you ideas that you
# haven't even though of. After that, you're ready to take your very first quiz of the
# course. Don't worry, it's just for practice.
