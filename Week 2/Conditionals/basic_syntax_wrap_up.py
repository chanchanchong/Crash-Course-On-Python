# You just completed your second module and learned a whole lot about
# Python syntax. Congrats, We've learned how to operate with different data
# types and how to create our own variables and expressions. We've defined
# our first functions and learned how to make them return values so that
# they're more reusable. We then dove into creating branches in our scripts
# which lets them act in different ways depending on the values of our
# variables. We learned a lot of new and very powerful stuff. Knowing how to
# structure your code and functions and how to make your code act in
# different ways depending on the values is what allows us to tell our
# computer what to do. We'll keep using these tools throughout the course
# as we move on to more complex and interesting things. Next step, you
# put everything you've learned to the test in the next graded assessment.
# Don't worry if you don't feel ready yet. Remember that you can re-watch
# the videos and do the practice quizzes as many times as you need to make
# sure you fully understand everything we've covered. When you're ready for
# the test, take your time and best of luck. I'll catch you after you finished in
# the next module, where we'll learn all about loops. See you there.
