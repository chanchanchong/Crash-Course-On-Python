# Hi there, welcome back, and well done for completing your first
# graded assessment. You're doing a great job making it this far. Chances
# are some topics we've covered may have been a little tricky at times,
# especially if you're completely new to programming. Don't worry if
# something wasn't obvious right away. We went through a lot of new
# concepts and it might take several passes until you feel comfortable with
# them. And that's totally normal. We all went through when we were
# learning how to code. In the previous module we explored some basic
# concepts, like programming and automation. We called out that each
# programming language has a specific syntax, which we need to learn so
# we can tell the computer what to do. We then got a sneak preview of some
# of the things we could do with Python. Up next, we'll dive deeper into
# some basic building blocks of Python syntax, things like variables,
# expressions, functions, and conditional blocks. At first glance these pieces
# may seem pretty simple, but when we start to combine them they become
# a lot more powerful. Understanding of programming language syntax
# isn't too different from learning a spoken language. For example, the best
# way to learn Spanish is to visit a Spanish speaking country, immerse
# yourself in the culture, listen to the people. Then figure out how to arrange
# the words to form a sentence that another speaker can understand. The
# same is true for programming. When you immerse yourself in Python
# programming you'll learn how to formulate statements of code that the
# computer can understand. This is called syntax. Okay, so as you go
# through the next few videos keep in mind that our main goal is to learn
# the language's syntax. So we'll focus on how to tell our computer what to
# do, not on how to get it to do complicated tasks. Like before, we'll run
# through some simple exercises to help you see the concepts in action. And
# as you pick up the new skills and get to grips with different tools we'll start
# to wrote more advanced scripts that tackle more challenging problems.
# Again, if at any point you feel confused or that something just isn't clear,
# remember you can watch the videos and take the practice quizzes as
# many times as you need. The key to getting good at programming is
# practice, practice and practice. You have to keep working your
# programming muscles in order to get strong, just like building muscles in
# the gym. Train hard, train regularly, and you'll be tackling more weighty
# coding problems in no time. All right, ready to jump back in? In the next
# video we're going to learn all about the data types. Let's get started.
