# In earlier videos, we called out that text written between quotes in Python
# is called a string. In programming terminology, a string is known as a data
# type, whether it's a mobile game or a script used to automatically create
# user accounts. Most programs need to manipulate some kind of data, and
# that data can come in a lot of different forums, or like we call them data
# types. A string is only one kind of data type found in Python. There's a
# bunch of others, like an integer which represents whole numbers without
# a fraction, like one, and float, which represents real numbers or in other
# words, a number with a fractional part like 2.5. Generally, you computer
# doesn't know how to mix different data types. For example, adding two
# integers together makes perfect sense to computer, like this. Adding
# together two strings also  ake sense. We just end up with the longer
# strings that contains the two, like so, but your computer doesn't know how
# to add a integer and a string. If you tell it to mix these two different data
# types, your computer isn't going to know what to do and will raise an
# error. Check it out. Oh, no our first error, but don't panic. Erros are a
# common part of programming, and you'll probably have to deal with them
# a lot. The trick is to think of errors as little clues from your computer to
# help you improve your programming skills. Read the erros carefully,
# understand what they're telling you, and then use that new knowledge to
# help you fix the mistake. In this example, the last line of the error message
# shows us that we've encountered something called a TypeError. When we
# get a bit explanatory texts, that tells us that the plus sign can't be used
# between an int type and an str type, which are short names for integer
# and string. Think about what we've already learned about strings,
# tell us? The message unsupported operand type, tells us that we can't add
# the integer seven and the string eight, because they're different data
# types, but what if you didn't have an instructor to helpfully pointed that
# out? How would you know? You'd need to use your research skills and the
# resources we called out earlier in the course to do some investigating. For
# example, you could look for information about the error by pasting the
# TypeError message into the search bar of your favorite search engine. This
# is a common trick used by almost everyone learning to code, and even by
# experienced developers. You'll usually find that other people on the
# internet have reported similar errors and solved them too. Back to our
# example. Maybe you're thinking, aren't we adding two numbers here?
# Looks a bit like it. Well, look carefully and remember that anything
# Wrapped in quotation marks is considered a string in Python. So eight is a
# string here, while seven is an integer. To the computer, adding seven plus
# eight is just as strange as adding seven plus A is to us, and seven plus A
# equals no sense at all. It might be helpful to think about data types in
# terms of information they can represent. For example, the name of a file
# would be represented as a string data types, while the size of that file
# might be an integer data type. If you're ever not 100 percent sure that
# data types a certain value is, Python gives you a handy way to find out. You
# can use the type function, to have the computer tell you the type. This
# might come in handy when dealing with code that someone else wrote
# and you're not sure what data types it's using. For example,
# pretty neat. This tells us that A belongs to str calss, which like we said
# earlier is short for string. The number 2, belongs to the int class, which is
# short for integer, and 2.5 belongs to the float class. We'll talk more about
# what we mean by class later in the course. For now, you can just use it as a
# synonym for data type. So now you know three very common data types in
# Python. There are plenty of others you'll be using soon, but don't worry
# about them at the moment. As we continue throgut the course, we'll
# come across more data types and learn how to interact with each of them.
# For now, just remember, mixing your data types will get your computer,
# well, all mixed up. So keep your strnigs with your strings, your integers
# with your integers, and your floats with your floats, and you shouldn't get
# in too much of a tangle.
