# Imagine you have to describe an apple to someone who's never
# seen one before, how would you do it? And what would you say, besides
# that it's delicious? You might start off by saying that an apple is a type of
# fruit. You might talk about how there are lots of different kinds of apples,
# each with own color, flavor and name. Well, when you're explaining
# concepts to your computer, it's a good idea to approach it in a similar way.
# Your computer has no idea what an apple is, or even what a fruit can be. If
# you want your computer to understand these things, you have to describe
# them in your programs and scripts. Up to now, we've discussed elements of
# syntax, like variables, functions, loops, and some more complex data
# structures, like lists and dictionaries. These are powerful tools in an IT
# specialist's toolbox, but it cna still be difficult to translate real-world
# concepts, like what's an apple, or what's a user account into programs. To
# make it easier for computers to understand these new concepts, Python
# uses a programming pattern called object-oriented programming, which
# model concepts using classes and objects. This is a flexible, powerful
# paradigm where classes represent and define concepts, while objects are
# instances of classes. In our apple example, we can have a class called apple
# that defines the characteristics of an apple. We could then have a bunch of
# instances of that apple class, which are the individual objects of that class.
# The idea of object-oriented programming might sound abstract and
# complex, but you've actually been using objects already without even
# realizing it. Almost everything in Python is an object, all of the numbers,
# strings, lists, and dictionaries we've seen so far, and have used in our
# exercises and quizzes, have been objects. And each of them was an instance
# of a class representing a concept. The core, apple pun intended, concept of
# object-oriented programming comes down to attributes and methods
# associated with a type. The attributes are the characteristics associated to a
# type, and the methods are the function associated to a type. In the apple
# example, the attributes are the color and flavor. What would the methods
# be? Well, it depends on what we're going to do with apple. We could maybe
# have a cut method that turns one whole apple into four slices, or we could
# have an eat method that reduces the amount of apple available with every
# bite. Let's think about a more IT focused example. like a file in our
# computer. A file has lots of attributes, it has a name, a size, the date it was
# created, permissions to access it, its contents, and a whole lot more. There
# are actually so many different file attributes, that Python has multiple
# classes to deal with files. The typical file object focuses on the file's
# contents, and so this object has a bunch of methods to read and modify
# what's inside the file. Hopefully, these examples help make object-oriented
# programming a little clearer, but don't worry if you haven't fully wrapped
# your head around it. In our next video, we'll explore how to apply these
# concepts to some classes and objects we've already used in Python, which
# will help us dig a little deeper into how this all works.
