# Welcome back and congrats on making it this far. Our journey together is
# getting more and more interesting, don't you think? Let's take a second to
# review what you've accomplished so far. We've now gone over all the basic
# syntax of Python and then checked out the most common data structures,
# strings, lists, dictionaries. These letters scripts do a bunch of cool things
# like processing text, iterating through elements to do an operation on each,
# finding out the frequency of an element and a whole lot more. In the next
# videos, we're going to focus on a bunch of new concepts. We're going to
# dive into object-oriented programming which is a way of thinking about and
# implementing our code. We'll discuss how to create our own objects and
# how to use many of Python's interesting capabilities. We've going to learn a
# lot of new terminology too. As usual, we'll include cheat sheets in the
# references and in the readings for you to refer to whenever you need a quick
# refresher. As always, if something isn't clear right away, remember that you
# cna review the content and do the practice exercises as many times as you
# need. Okay, Ready for your orientation on object-oriented programming?
# There's a lot to cover, so let's jump right in.
